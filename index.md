I'm Mack Phillips, a rising junior at Agnes Scott College. I'm majoring in biology and minoring in environmental and sustainability studies. My areas of interest are entomology, marine biology and - most relevant of all - computational ecology, in which I have the most experience.

> ## The Effects of the Spotted Lanterflies Invasion on Biodiversity in Bird Populations
>   During the summer of 2024, I participated in a REU at my home institution in which I utilized citizen science data from eBird and EDDMapS to determine the effect the Spotted Lanternfly invasion had on biodiversity in bird populations residing in counties surrounding the location in which they were initially found.

> ## Interrelatedness in Biodiversity among Species in Aquatic Communities
> In the spring of 2025, I participated in a Data Intensive Ecology course wherein I used NEON data from 5 site to determine if fluctuations in biodiversity among certain populations in an ecosystem would effect others.
